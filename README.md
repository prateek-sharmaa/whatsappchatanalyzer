It can be said that the capabilities of the WhatsApp application and the power of the python programming language in implementing whatever network data analysis intended, cannot be overemphasized. This work was able to discuss the WhatsApp application and its libraries, to create an analysis of a WhatsApp group chat and visually represent the top 10 and top 20 users in the chat groups. A pseudocode of the plot was given and at the end, visual representation of the plot was implemented. Also, an analysis of the top 10 and top 20 users were done. The system was done with python, and the python libraries that were implemented includes, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. At the end of the work expected results were obtained and the analysis was able to show the level of participation of the various individuals on the given WhatsApp group. On serious note this system has the ability to analyze any WhatsApp group data input into it.
